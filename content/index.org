Create modern presentations using ORG mode and ~reveal.js~. Also learn how to use [[https://c3js.org/][c3js]],
[[https://plantuml.com/][plantUML]], literate programming effectively and document everything as code.
* About
This page lists all slides/presentations I've published. I use Emacs, ORG mode and some
HTML/CSS to generate this page. For the presentations I use [[https://revealjs.com][reveal.js]]. You may want to
have a look at the [[https://github.com/dorneanu/slides][slides]] repository.
